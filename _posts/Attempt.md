# EDIT AI Program Overview

## Summary

EDIT AI is dedicated to fostering long-term engagement in STEM programming research among high school students from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds. Our goal is to inspire these students to pursue careers in medical AI by improving the accessibility of complex subject matter. 



## Program Structure

The EDIT AI program is designed with a **three-track structure** to facilitate differentiated learning as students develop their skills:

- **Skills Development**: Building foundational coding knowledge and technical skills.
- **Advanced Research**: Engaging in higher-level research activities and projects.
- **Mentoring**: Receiving guidance from both professional mentors and near-peer mentors.

## Goals

- **Encourage Diverse Participation**: We aim to increase diversity in the STEM workforce by providing opportunities for both professional and near-peer mentoring.
- **Engage/introduce students to the crossection of AI and Medicine**: Students will learn about programming, medicine, and AI, and will conduct varying levels of guided research projects into these topics, and will present on them. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_vOhGG3d1A)
- **Support Teachers**: Sustaining teacher-driven curriculum design and engagement to enhance the learning experience.
- **Inform Educators**: Providing insights into the long-term impacts of remote learning and identifying best practices and supports necessary for the success of underrepresented students in STEM fields.

## Impact

Our program will contribute to a more diverse and inclusive STEM workforce and provide valuable information to educators about effective strategies and supports for underrepresented students, as well as enable the next generation to use and judge AI technologies responsibly, and without stigma.
